## Overall

This is a great start. The baskets are beautiful, and the core interaction is working. The following items are adjustments and refinements to improve clarity, correctness, and feel.

---

## Visual Scale & Separation

1. **Ball size**

   * The ball is too small relative to the basket.

2. **Basket separation / week clarity**

   * Baskets are separated, but the separation between weeks is not visually clear.
   * Slightly increasing the gap between week groupings would help distinguish weeks at a glance.

---

## Labels & Time Readability

3. **Day labels missing**

   * Day names or dates are not visible.

4. **Desired day label treatment**

   * Add day labels (e.g., `MON 7`, `TUE 8`, `WED 9`).
   * These should appear visually *in front of* each basket, as if resting on the table surface.
   * The labels should feel dimensional (3D), subtle, and elegant.
   * Labels should not overpower or distract from the baskets.

5. **Month / week labels**

   * Week labels appear to be working correctly.
   * Month and day labels are incomplete or missing, as previously discussed.

## Light / Highlight Behavior

6. **Light behavior incorrect**

   * The highlight/light does not move correctly with its basket.
   * This issue is annotated in the provided screenshots.

---

## Ball Behavior & Physics

7. **Incorrect basket targeting**

   * The ball does not always appear to enter the intended basket.

8. **Ball motion / bounce**

   * The ball does not feel bouncy enough when dropped.
   * Desired behavior: when the ball drops into a basket, it should bounce around slightly before settling.
   * Adjusting scale, mass, or physics may help.

---

## Scrolling & Input

9. **Dragging works well**

   * Click-and-drag interaction behaves correctly and feels natural in a 3D context.

10. **Scroll speed too aggressive**

* Scroll input moves too far too fast.
* Scrolling currently feels like it advances by months rather than days.
* Scroll sensitivity or scale likely needs adjustment.

## Supporting Materials

11. **Reference assets provided**

* Four annotated screenshots are located in the `One_changes/docs` folder.
* An `issues.md` file in the same folder enumerates the annotations shown in the images.
* These materials describe the issues visually and should be used as reference.
